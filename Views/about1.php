            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1> <br>
            Hi there! Iâ€™m Andrea<br>
            <br>
            I'm a self proclaimed expert on keeping my distance and working remotely.<br> 
            If the current news on coronavirus (COVID-19) is making you feel anxious, concerned or stressed,<br>
            I've curated the best quality content to share with you in areas of health, well-being, food and entertainment.<br>
            <br>
            Welcome to My Diary!

    What makes My Diary different? <br>
    <br>
    Well, every time I sit down to brainstorm and create content ideas,<br>
    I think of what it would be like if you collected the most creative, stylish, thoughtful, people on the planet & force them to sit at home indefinitely.<br> 
    What do they want to talk about? What would they like to share? What new skill would they like to learn? 
    Some people are concerned with their health and fitness,<br> some others would love to host virtual parties, others would like to withdraw from the world, and some are just clueless about what to do with all this time.<br> 
    There are so many unanswered questions and other are just looking for inspiration.<br>
    <br>
    My Diary answers all of these in a nutshell: It is my attempt to combine all of those brilliant ideas and tips into one site. As if the lockdown never happened.</p>
