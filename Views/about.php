            <b>Hi there, we're the SuperGlobals</b><br>
            <br>
            We are Zara, Afua, Tomi, Maura and Ciara, 5 aspiring Software Engineers on the eve of finishing our Get into Tech course with Sky :(.
            We've had a somewhat interesting (and unexpected) learning experience due to the outbreak of Covid 19,
            but we never let the distance between us stop us in achieving our end goal ! So for our final project we decided to dedicate our blog to this slightly strange time we're all experiencing.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Welcome to Diary of a Distancer!</b>
        </p>

        <b>What makes our Diary different?</b> <br>
    <br>
    Well, firstly, our blood, sweat and tears have gone into this blog!
    It is the product of 15 weeks of onsite and virtual classes, countless hours of Zoom catch ups and an incessantly pinging WhatsApp group. But I think I speak for all of us when I say its been a great experience and we can't believe its over.<br>
    We're all in agreement that our group effort in offering each-other support is what we enjoyed most about this project, its going to be weird not seeing eachothers little pixelated faces on the screen everyday.<br>
    <br>
    And on that note, we've come up with some ways in which we're going to pass our time in quarantine now the course has finished.
   So please feel free to have a little digital wonder around our blog for some top ideas on how to pass your remaining weeks at home (no GitHub involved, promise). </p>
