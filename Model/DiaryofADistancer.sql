('Instagram DJ Live sessions', 'In the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 (otherwise known as coronavirus) governments and health organizations around the world have called for people to help prevent the spread of the virus by staying in their homes and avoiding large public gatherings. This practice of “social distancing” has obviously had a detrimental impact on the live music and nightlife industries. As a result of this shocking turn of events, an untold number of nightclubs and venues have been forced to close their doors leaving DJs and beatmakers with no place to play and party-goers with no places to party. Utilizing common audio and video technology, the music community has responded with many DJs and beatmakers opting to stream their live mixes and beat sets from the comfort of their own homes. No one has capitalized on this trend quite like legendary DJ D-Nice.', '2020-04-11 12:00:00'),
('Disney plus better than Netflix', 'Disney Plus, the entertainment giant''s online hub to stream almost everything it produces, has grown into a megahit, and its popularity that has climbed during the  coronavirus  pandemic. Disney Plus streams shows and movies from Disney''s franchises including Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar, and all the family-friendly movies and animation from Disney itself, plus new originals and programming it acquired by taking over Fox, like The Simpsons. Now with movies theaters shut down because of the pandemic, Disney Plus is becoming company''s option to release new big-screen films too. Artemis Fowl, a sci-fi fantasy based on a popular series of young-adult books, was last scheduled for theatrical release May 29. Instead, the company is turning it into a Disney Plus original film, skipping theaters entirely. Artemis Fowl will be released to stream on Disney Plus on June 12. As containment measures have shuttered cinemas and forced families to entertain themselves at home more than ever, Disney has been tweaking Disney Plus''s role in other ways too.

Speaking at the press conference where the government confirmed it was extending the UK''s lockdown for at least three weeks, Sir Patrick Vallance said that "the way out" of the pandemic was through the development of a vaccine. But he warned that in the interim we could see changes in how the lockdown was being administered.In his answer Sir Patrick also suggested certain measures - like working from home - could be around for a while. He said there may be a "number of measures that need to continue in order to allow that to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along". He told reporters: "There will be some changes [to how we live] I think that need to take place, that have already taken place, around things like home working, that are going to be important to maintain that ability to break transmission.

('Eat Clean and Fresh whilst in isolation', 'The \"clean-eating\" craze has reached new levels of popularity — just check out the 58 million #EatClean posts on Instagram — but it''s a trend that''s been bugging me more and more lately, so I feel like it''s time to clarify a few things. Namely: What does \"clean eating\" even mean?\r\n\r\nThe phrase began with good intentions: It used to imply eating lots of whole, real foods — veggies, fruit, whole grains, animal and plant-based protein, nuts, seeds, and oils. It also meant you should eat as close to nature as possible — minimally processed, not packaged, or originating from a factory. Cooking at home and finding good ingredients were encouraged.I do love that the original concept prompted an important question: Where does our food come from? So, if a clean eating mindset reminds you to read labels, check sources, and understand what''s what about the food you eat, I''d absolutely encourage you to keep that up. To be clear: As a registered dietitian, it''s absolutely not my style to bash anyone else''s way of eating — ever! RDs like me are pretty gung-ho about the fact that our evidence-based opinions on what you eat are irrelevant unless you''re actively seeking our advice.\r\n\r\nBut these days, I''m worried that the phrase \"clean eating\" has taken on a new, misguided meaning. The implication is that if you''re not \"eating clean,\" what you eat otherwise is dirty, lazy, or unhygienic, and that''s simply not true.\r\n\r\nIt''s morphed from a sense of awareness about food into a diet-driven caste system. Not only does the phrase establish a hierarchical model for eating well, it''s yet another medium for food-shaming. The part I dislike the most: It disregards the access — including time and money — required to find perfect, farmer''s market-fresh food. Frankly, it''s elitist. Instead of educating ourselves about food, we''re simply idealizing being thin above all else. The other frustrating thing about \"clean eating\" is that the phrase misrepresents scientific evidence on food ingredients. More and more marketers refer to their food products as \"clean.\" But if your product is 90% full of a trendy version of oil or sugar, it''s still not providing consumers with healthful, educated choices.\r\n\r\nDon''t believe me? Agave is no better for you than any other version of sugar; coconut oil is still a mostly saturated fat (even when your kale salad is doused in it); cold-pressed juice is still a concentrated source of sugar (and not very nutritious); and that vegan chocolate pudding is still dessert — not breakfast.\r\n\r\nMy bottom line is this: There are too many things that already make many of us — especially women — feel bad about ourselves. Nobody needs to take on the extra baggage of clean eating too. But in a world with countless product claims (especially on food) it''s hard to know how to make the best choices.', '2020-04-14 15:00:00'),

('weight training vs cardio indoors', 'Going by stereotypes and heavily simplifying, you could say that endurance athletes have traditionally steered clear from weights in fear of bulking up, whereas bodybuilders avoid cardio equipment like the plague, horrified that using them will eat away their hard-earned sizeable muscles. The logic seems simple enough: If your objective is to slim down – or to effortlessly run for hours – strength training isn’t the way to go.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you want to get hefty biceps, the exercise bike does little to help you reach your goal. But is there more to the story? WHICH IS BETTER: CARDIO OR STRENGTH TRAINING? There is more when it comes to the question of cardio vs. weights. It’s kind of impossible to say that one is better than the other as in physical exercise, versatility is key and comes with several benefits. Let’s take weight loss for an example. At first glance, it would appear that the workout that consumes the most calories is the way to go – after all, losing weight is a straightforward equation of calorie intake minus calories burned. For someone who wishes to slim down, physical exercise is a way to maximize the latter so heading for cardio machines seems like a no-brainer. Yet, total calorie consumption isn’t just the immediate numbers on the screen of a cardio machine. For people wanting to lose weight, a key reason to incorporate strength training into their weekly workout routines is the effect muscle mass has on energy consumption. The beauty of muscle tissue from a weight-loss perspective is that it uses up more energy than fat tissue, even at rest. Growing your muscles, therefore, translates to bigger TDEE – Total Daily Energy Expenditure – even when you do nothing with those music. It’s true, however, that muscle tissue also weighs more than fat, but if that’s something you’re worried about, ask yourself this: Would you rather weigh less and have more fat on you, or weigh more and have a bigger percentage of that weight be solid, defined muscle?', '2020-04-24 15:20:34'),

('Zone in with Yoga', 'Lucy Edge, YogaClicks founder and author of Yoga School Dropout, has pulled together some top tips for using yoga and mindfulness to ease your crisis anxiety and give yourself a much-needed moment of calm. I asked some of London’s best yoga, meditation and mindfulness teachers to share what they will be doing to stay calm, boost their immune system, and get a good night’s sleep,’ explains Lucy. Connect with your breath The best way to stay calm is to connect with your breath. ‘As soon we connect with our breath, we calm our nervous system and shift it from the so-called sympathetic nervous system (flight or fight) to the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest),’ says yoga teacher Annabel Chown. ‘Focusing on the exhale is particularly good for soothing the nervous system, as it feels grounding and releasing. ‘Try lengthening your exhale – say inhaling for a count of four, exhaling for eight, to quickly calm yourself.’  Stay present Often the problem isn’t what’s actually happening but what might happen, which makes us feel unsafe and panicky. Annabel’s remedy is mindfulness which, for her, means staying in the moment. She does this by focusing fully on what she’s doing and not thinking about anything else.', '2020-04-24 15:25:06'),

But Sport England chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said there were “areas of real concern” over the “unprecedented disruption the pandemic and lockdown is having on people’s activity habits”. And Rutherford, who also won world, European and Commonwealth long jump titles, said: “On one level, I guess the lockdown is a free pass to be a couch potato and say I’ll just stay in and watch TV instead all the time.

('Who knew I would become a runner', 'As Britain (and the world) adjusts to social distancing, our daily routines have been thrown into disarray. You might find yourself asking ‘Do I even need to get dressed anymore?’ (Yes), is it OK to spend all day binging Tiger King (Not only is it ‘OK’, it’s essential) and, really, how hard should I be working to get that isolation six pack? The fact that Boris’ ‘soft lockdown’ announcement made provisions for daily exercise is a sure fire sign that as a nation, we’ve come to understand just how vital exercise is for our bodies and minds; that we’re still allowed out for a jog around the park in the midst of a pandemic is no small thing. But, with the simple act of lacing up and getting out potentially putting your health or that of stranger at risk, it’s clear we need a smarter approach to our daily jog. With that in mind, we tracked down some of the best runners around and asked their advice on staying safe and outpacing illness. I want to respect Coronavirus social distancing rules, but my usual route is pretty busy. What do I do“Speeding up to pass every person you see might make your run a little too sweaty,” says Stephen Scullion, a professional runner representing both Ireland and Under Armour. “Ive done my best to be courteous to others. Often its meant having to slow down and wait on the curb side, or if the road is clear I might even cross over to a footpath nearby.” “I think the best thing you can do is be alert to your surroundings, and that might mean turning the volume of music down to ensure you can hear people around you and not get distracted,” he continues. “Remember to exercise safely; if we stick to the social isolation and keep the two metre distance we can shake this virus much quicker and the pandemic can pass.

Tolani Shoneye: “Since its launch in 2016, the podcast has grown in ways we did not expect, in under three years it has reached over five million listens. But the impact has not only been in the listens, the biggest impact has been the sisterhood built off the podcast. Speaking our truths has allowed other people who listen to speak their own truths. We have built a, ‘You can sit with us, and everyone is welcome’ attitude and space, so that’s been the biggest impact. That and the fact that we have told women to leave crappy relationships. Our podcast allows us to tell our individual stories. It is not concerned with a set format or perfection, The Receipts Podcast wants its audience to feel like they are a part of the conversation, rather than being talked at. With Yxng Bane, the interview was so much fun and we got him to open up more than he normally would. One Acen was great, he did a Your Receipts with us and he was so good at answering dilemmas and gave such good, well, goodish advice. And Ms Banks, who we all love so much, was hilarious and has the most soothing voice. We spoke about relationship, star signs, cheating exes and she even entertained a rap battle that we made her judge.” What are your goals for it going forward? “The goals are just to get bigger and bigger, and make sure everyone and their nan is listening to the podcast. We can fit the show into so many different formats, live, TV, so much can be done. It’s always so hard thinking of the goals, because the podcast grew so much faster than we thought, we always say it’s like we’re catching up and getting used to dreaming bigger. Now this is a big ask but, in the vein of dreaming big, we would love to get Michelle Obama on the podcast, that would be amazing and Jenifer Lewis would be great too. Beyoncé, Rihanna and Drake of course, Charlamagne Tha God, Cardi B, Jordyn Woods (because we can be messy and we want all the Kardashian tea) and Gemma Collins for the laughs. ”What did your association with BBC 1Xtra do for you? “Working with 1Xtra was amazing for us, not only did it open us up to a new audience, but it gave us a level of credibility. It meant we could bring conversations we were having into the mainstream. It also meant that our parents finally knew what we were doing, because we were on the BBC – it was the first time we had a team outside of just us three, we had an amazing producer and social media manager. Being on 1Xtra also allowed us to reach No.1 in the UK podcast charts, making it the first podcast produced and hosted by women of colour to reach No.1.” You’ve also signed an exclusive deal with Spotify…“It’s great and even more so because Spotify have invested in us.

Making the podcast each week is so much fun and we’ve worked really hard to get to where we are today.

The second series ended in Rome. After a difficult operation, Eve (played by Golden Globe, SAG and Critics’ Choice Award winner Sandra Oh) was about to run away with Villanelle (played by Emmy and BAFTA winner Jodie Comer), but as Eve realized the contract killer had tricked her into ruthlessly killing the scary handler Raymond (Adrian Scarborough) with an axe, she refuses to go with her. Villanelle thus shot Eve. A reversal of the ending of the first series in which Eve had stabbed Villanelle. Of course, Eve has not yet been killed (otherwise there clearly wouldn’t be a third series). The efficient assassin did not check to see if her victim was really dead (or perhaps for sentimental reasons did not want to). Eve is back in London, although the first episode makes us think at first that she has moved to South Korea, as we see her buy noodles in a supermarket, presumably in China Town. She is no longer working for MI6, but is chopping vegetables in the kitchens of a Korean restaurant. Eve is clearly pretty miserable in her new life. We find Villanelle in the first episode of the new series at her wedding ceremony marrying a rich Spanish woman. She clearly isn’t over her “ex” as she mentions Eve in her wedding speech. “I’m much happier now she’s dead,” she says with only the bride bursting out laughing. A new character crashes the wedding, which turns the ceremony into a brawl. For the rest of the episode, the rich Spanish bride seems to have been completely forgotten. This new character is Dasha, played by Dame Harriet Walter. She is Villanelle’s trainer and now handler as she persuades Villanelle to go back to being a contract killer. Dasha is portrayed as a ruthless killer, now teaching children gymnastics in Barcelona. It will be interesting to see how this character develops. This first episode of the third series is rather tame, with a shocking death—of a beloved character—at the end. Eve and Villanelle are trying to forget each other in this third series, but this shocking death will inevitably bring them together. For executive producer Sally Woodward Gentle, this new series is “about identity, self-determination and chaos.” Will their obsession for one another finally come to an end in this series?

('Mindfulness - NHS Advice', 'It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much.Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing.You can check your mood using this simple mood self-assessment quiz. Some people call this awareness "mindfulness". Mindfulness can help us enjoy life more and understand ourselves better. You can take steps to develop it in your own life. What is mindfulness? Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says that mindfulness means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment. "It''s easy to stop noticing the world around us. It''s also easy to lose touch with the way our bodies are feeling and to end up living ''in our heads'' – caught up in our thoughts without stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour," he says. "An important part of mindfulness is reconnecting with our bodies and the sensations they experience. This means waking up to the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the present moment. That might be something as simple as the feel of a banister as we walk upstairs. "Another important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they happen moment to moment. "It''s about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can positively change the way we see ourselves and our lives. "How mindfulness helps mental wellbeing Becoming more aware of the present moment can help us enjoy the world around us more and understand ourselves better. When we become more aware of the present moment, we begin to experience afresh things that we have been taking for granted. "Mindfulness also allows us to become more aware of the stream of thoughts and feelings that we experience," says Professor Williams, "and to see how we can become entangled in that stream in ways that are not helpful. "This lets us stand back from our thoughts and start to see their patterns. Gradually, we can train ourselves to notice when our thoughts are taking over and realise that thoughts are simply mental events that do not have to control us. "Most of us have issues that we find hard to let go and mindfulness can help us deal with them more productively. We can ask: ''Is trying to solve this by brooding about it helpful, or am I just getting caught up in my thoughts? "Awareness of this kind also helps us notice signs of stress or anxiety earlier and helps us deal with them better. "nMindfulness is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to prevent depression in people who have had 3 or more bouts of depression in the past. See the NICE guideline on depression in adults. How to be more mindful: Reminding yourself to take notice of your thoughts, feelings, body sensations and the world around you is the first step to mindfulness. Notice the everyday: "Even as we go about our daily lives, we can notice the sensations of things, the food we eat, the air moving past the body as we walk," says Professor Williams. "All this may sound very small, but it has huge power to interrupt the ''autopilot'' mode we often engage day to day, and to give us new perspectives on life. Keep it regular. It can be helpful to pick a regular time – the morning journey to work or a walk at lunchtime – during which you decide to be aware of the sensations created by the world around you. Try something new: Trying new things, such as sitting in a different seat in meetings or going somewhere new for lunch, can also help you notice the world in a new way. Watch your thoughts: "Some people find it very difficult to practice mindfulness. As soon as they stop what they''re doing, lots of thoughts and worries crowd in," says Professor Williams. "It might be useful to remember that mindfulness isn''t about making these thoughts go away, but rather about seeing them as mental events. "Imagine standing at a bus station and seeing ''thought buses'' coming and going without having to get on them and be taken away. This can be very hard at first, but with gentle persistence it is possible. "Some people find that it is easier to cope with an over-busy mind if they are doing gentle yoga or walking." Name thoughts and feelings:\r\nTo develop an awareness of thoughts and feelings, some people find it helpful to silently name them: "Here''s the thought that I might fail that exam". Or, "This is anxiety". Free yourself from the past and future: You can practise mindfulness anywhere, but it can be especially helpful to take a mindful approach if you realise that, for several minutes, you have been "trapped" in reliving past problems or "pre-living" future worries.', '2020-04-24 16:50:54'),

Headsapce intro page Headsapce intro page\r\n\r\nCalm welcome page\r\nCalm welcome page\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGamification of meditation\r\nWe love to compete, we love rewards and whether we know it or not, we love gamification. What this means, is that we love to play life like a computer game. Gamification is a way to increase engagement, participation and loyalty through using computer game mechanics. CrossFit has turned the gym into ‘The Sport of Fitness’, NikeRun have done it with running, Giff Gaff have even done it with a mobile phone network. With meditation you get ‘run streaks’, badges for completion, and rewards from other meditators. Seeing my journey and all my stats is a visual reward that makes me feel like all the time spent meditating is being counted and therefore not lost in the sands of time. Headspace does gamification better than Calm. With Headspace I can see all the packs I have done and feel a sense of accomplishment. While Calm has a useful way of tracking; it doesn’t make me feel as much of a mediation bawse as Headspace. Usability Both apps are incredibly simple. There are very clear guidelines for beginners. There are plenty of packs to explore for experienced meditators. In terms of getting the most out of the app, Headspace wins out. There is a clear path, there are useful guidelines and I know what I have to do to become a better meditator. Calm has so many features and extras that I am sometimes left with FOMO. Perhaps if I had spent as much time with Calm as Headspace I wouldn’t have this problem. If you are someone who will use all the extra music and stories then you may prefer Calm but if you just want to get stuck into meditation and feel supported, then Headspace is the one for you. Comparing the visuals of the apps, Headspace’s bright orange, zesty interface invigorates me and keeps me coming back. Calm is too generic looking. Its nature pictures are cliched. Headspace uses cartoons and makes the esoteric world of meditation more friendly and relatable. Given that so many people come into meditation with a sceptical view of the hippy-dippy stuff, I think Headspace works better. The Voices of Meditation Now you may not realise this now, but you are going to develop a pretty deep relationship with one of the narrators of these apps. If, like me, you get to spend 180 hours meditating you are going to get pretty intimate with Andy or Tamara. They are going to be with you in some of your most blissful and emotional moments; so it''s pretty important that you like who you are going to spend all this time with. Andy is the co-founder of Headspace and has a very relaxing, English, zen-like voice, born out of his time as a Buddhist Monk. While Tamara is the head of meditation content at Calm. She delivers your sessions with a lovingly enthusiastic American accent. In the past, Headspace’s instructional videos were of Andy speaking to the camera but they have recently been overhauled with some nice cartoons. While this served to heighten the connection with Andy, the cartoons are easier to gain an understanding of the concepts of meditation. This is just a personal preference but I prefer Tamara of Calm’s loving kindness when I am trying to relax. I often found myself longing for the sessions to last a bit longer to soak in more of her nurturing tones.\r\n\r\nWhat matters most\r\nHeadspace has a clear path of progress in meditation. You know where you are going on your 30 day journey and this gamification makes me want to keep coming back and maintain my streak of consistency. Calm has so much variety that you can get a bit lost with what to choose. We make so many choices in our daily lives that it''s nice to have meditation decided for me. If you are someone who gets overwhelmed with choice and eventually gives up then Headspace is going to be the one for you. Given that consistency is the most important aspect of meditation, then Headspace’s platform is a big winner here.', '2020-03-19 17:41:30'),
('Let''s stretch', 'Do any of these lines sound familiar? You have to hold a stretch to get the benefit. Don''t bounce in the stretch - you''ll tear your muscle. If you dont stretch before a workout, you''ll hurt yourself. Well, they''re all wrong. But first, there''s a bigger question to answer. Do You Need to Stretch at All? It''s a good idea, says the American College of Sports Medicine. The ACSM recommends stretching each of the major muscle groups at least two times a week for 60 seconds per exercise. Staying flexible as you age is a good idea. It helps you move better. For example, regular stretching can help keep your hips and hamstrings flexible later in life, says Lynn Millar, PhD. She''s a physical therapist and professor at Winston-Salem State University. If your posture or activities are a problem, make it a habit to stretch those muscles regularly. If you have back pain from sitting at a desk all day, stretches that reverse that posture could help.', '2020-04-28 16:41:30'),
('Breathing through this pandemic', 'This calming breathing technique for stress, anxiety and panic takes just a few minutes and can be done anywhere. You will get the most benefit if you do it regularly, as part of your daily routine. You can do it standing up, sitting in a chair that supports your back, or lying on a bed or yoga mat on the floor. Make yourself as comfortable as you can. If you can, loosen any clothes that restrict your breathing. If you''re lying down, place your arms a little bit away from your sides, with the palms up. Let your legs be straight, or bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. If you''re sitting, place your arms on the chair arms. If you''re sitting or standing, place both feet flat on the ground. Whatever position you''re in, place your feet roughly hip-width apart. Let your breath flow as deep down into your belly as is comfortable, without forcing it. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Breathe in gently and regularly. Some people find it helpful to count steadily from 1 to 5. You may not be able to reach 5 at first. Then, without pausing or holding your breath, let it flow out gently, counting from 1 to 5 again, if you find this helpful. Keep doing this for 3 to 5 minutes.', '2020-04-24 16:50:54'),

('You are taking the flour? ', 'The coronavirus pandemic has had a huge and far-reaching impact on daily life, from lockdowns being implemented in countries around the world to shortages in various household items. Previously panic buying was the reason why supermarkets were running short on things like toilet paper and bleach, but now there’s a new shortage blighting our shelves – people are having a hard time getting their hands on flour. Here’s what we know about why this flour shortage has cropped up in the midst of the Covid-19 lockdown. Why is there a flour shortage? It seems as though the new trend of baking as a way to distract and entertain onesself during lockdown has led to people buying up all the flour. Director general of the National Association of British and Irish Millers, Alex Waugh, has said that sales of flour in shops has increased since the outbreak and subsequent lockdown began, adding that the need to have the flour in small bags to be sold is partly to blame for the lack of flour in stores. He said: ‘UK millers have been working round the clock – genuinely milling flour 24-hours-day-seven-days-a-week to double the production of retail flour in an effort to meet demand. If you find that your local shop isn’t stocking flour, there are other options for you to carry on baking to your heart’s content. For starters, there are plenty of flour-less recipes out there for a wealth of things such as pancakes, peanut butter cookies and lemon drizzle cake. You could also make your own flour at home using just whole-grain, rice, dried beans, or oats, a coffee grinder or food processor and a fine mesh sieve.', '2020-04-02 12:14:00'),
('Baking Boom', 'These days, when you look at many of your friend''s instagram posts, there is a good chance that a lot of them are pictures of loaves of bread they have baked at home. During the coronavirus lockdown across Europe, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find flour at shops and supermarkets. One possible reason is the disruption to supply chains, caused by the lockdown. Another reason could be that confined citizens are turning their kitchens into amateur bakeries. In fact, around the world, Google searches for bread recipes and baking tips are on the rise, and that is turning baking supplies into precious commodities. The Spanish government recently reported that flour sales have quadrupled, during the third week of the country''s COVID-19 lockdown. In the UK, flour producers have doubled production, but are still struggling to meet the demand. In France, flour sales are up by an estimated 140%. Cooking and baking are known to have comforting, anti-stress effects. Bread, especially sourdough, demands patience, knowledge and a fair amount of skill. But when we do manage to produce a decent loaf with just flour, water and salt, like our ancestors, it becomes a thing of pride. We asked two longtime bread advocates and master bakers - Australia''s Dan Lepard, and Spain''s Iban Yarza - what they think of the current, global, baking pan-demic, and the possible reasons behind it. Dan Lepard "The lockdown is improving our skills for life "[Besides being a baker, Lepard is a chef, author, and TV presenter. Lately, he has been flooded with messages and requests for advice from people who have taken to the oven.] Baking bread potentially offers stress-relief if you start simply and continue to bake to the point of success. It’s offers a glimpse into the workings of “cognitive behaviour therapy” that strengthens your problem-solving skills in a somewhat manageable way. However, this coronavirus crisis has highlighted how many people have no skills whatsoever in baking, yet were ready to buy all the flour and yeast they could and somehow give it a go. As a baker working in a media bubble, my interaction has always been with people who either want to bake or can bake, who follow and are interested in me because I share their curiosity about baking.Until now.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I get messages, photos, questions every hour of the day on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. And many are panicked requests because they’ve realised they are out of their depth when tasked with baking a simple loaf of bread. Modern life, and television too, has encouraged us to believe that the simple things in life – like baking bread - must be intrinsically easy or else we’re doing them wrong.', '2020-04-21 13:44:00'),
('The Wonderfully Weird Tiger King','Tiger King Murder, Mayhem and Madness is a 2020 American true crime documentary miniseries about the life of zookeeper Joe Exotic. It was released on Netflix on March 20, 2020.The series focuses on the small but deeply interconnected society of big cat conservationists such as Carole Baskin, owner of Big Cat Rescue, and collectors such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals. A special hosted by Joel McHale was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.
The series received acclaim from critics, and according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release,ranking as one of Netflixs most successful releases to date.The series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of big cat conservationists and collectors in America,and the private zoos and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is Joe Exotic, the eccentric owner of the G.W. Zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, and his bitter years-long feud with Carole Baskin, CEO of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa,
Florida. Baskin presents herself as an animal rights activist whose mission is to provide a sanctuary for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, 
legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which PETA and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin murdered her second husband Don Lewis, who has been missing since 1997.Joe Exotics personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial three-way same-sex marriage to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for President of the United States and 2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer Rick Kirkham recounts the rise and fall of "Joe Exotic TV", a sort of podcast that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotics conviction under federal murder-for-hire statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin;
his conviction also includes violations of the Lacey Act and Endangered Species Act, and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.Other characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including Bhagavan Antle, an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a Las Vegas playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential informant for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic.Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.','2020-04-21 13:45:00'),
